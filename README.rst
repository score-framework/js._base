This is the base module providing initialization helpers for all other modules.
It does exactly *nothing* on its own, except providing a function *extend*,
that can be used to, well, extend the originally useless object.

Quickstart
==========

Browser
-------

Just make sure this module is loaded before all other score modules:

.. code-block:: html

    <script src="score.init.js"></script>
    <script src="score.dom.js"></script>
    <script>
        score.dom('body').addClass('spam');
    </script>

With require.js_
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: html

    <script src="require.js"></script>
    <script>
        require(['score.init', 'score.dom'], function(score) {
            score.dom('body').addClass('spam');
        });
    </script>

It is recommended to ``define()`` score with all its modules under a single URL
to make things more convenient:

.. code-block:: javascript

    // in score.js
    define(['score.init', 'score.dom'], function(score) {
        return score;
    });

.. code-block:: html

    <!-- in index.html -->
    <script src="require.js"></script>
    <script>
        require(['score'], function(score) {
            score.dom('body').addClass('spam');
        });
    </script>

.. _require.js: http://requirejs.org/


Node.js_
--------

.. code-block:: javascript

    var score = require('score.init'); require('score.oop');
    score.oop.Class({
        __name__: 'Bird'.
    });

.. _Node.js: https://nodejs.org/

Details

Extending
---------

Adding modules to *score* is as simple as calling *extend()*:

.. code-block:: html

    <script src="score.init.js"></script>
    <script>
        score.extend('spam', [], function(score) {
            return function() {
                alert('spam!');
            };
        });
        score.spam(); // will show an alert with the text 'spam!'
    </script>

The second parameter (the empty array), is a list of dependencies. If your
module need another module, it will not be available until all dependencies
were loaded:

.. code-block:: html

    <script src="score.init.js"></script>
    <script>
        score.extend('knight', ['swallow'], function(score) {
            // ...
        });
        try {
            score.knight; // This will throw an Error, since the module
                          // 'swallow' was not loaded yet.
        } catch (e) {
        }
        score.extend('swallow', [], function(score) {
            // ...
        });
        score.knight; // The module is now available, as all dependencies
                      // were loaded
    </script>

This behaviour has the effect, that you only need to make sure, that
``score.init`` is loaded before any other score modules. The loading order of
the other modules become irrelevant. This is important when using score in
the browser without require.js.

noConflict()
------------

It is possible, to remove the score variable from the global scope by using its
``noConflict()`` function:

.. code-block:: html

    <script>
        (function(score) {
            // do something with score
        })(score.noConflict());
        // the score variable no longer exists
    </script>
